API-FOOTBALL (3.9.3)
support: https://dashboard.api-football.com
URL: https://www.api-football.com
Introduction
Welcome to Api-Football! You can use our API to access all API endpoints, which can get information about Football Leagues & Cups.

We have language bindings in C, C#, cURL, Dart, Go, Java, Javascript, NodeJs, Objective-c, OCaml, Php, PowerShell, Python, Ruby, Shell and Swift! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

The update frequency indicated in the documentation is given as an indication and may vary for certain competitions.

Authentication
We uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new API key in our dashboard.

The accounts on RapidAPI and on our Dashboard are dissociated. Each of these registration methods has its own URL and API-KEY. You must therefore adapt your scripts according to your subscription by adapting the URL and your API-KEY.

RAPIDAPI : https://api-football-v1.p.rapidapi.com/v3/

API-SPORTS : https://v3.football.api-sports.io/

Our API expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

Make sure to replace XxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXx with your API key.

REQUESTS HEADERS & CORS

The API is configured to work only with GET requests and allows only the headers listed below:

x-rapidapi-host
x-rapidapi-key
x-apisports-key
If you make non-GET requests or add headers that are not in the list, you will receive an error from the API.

Some frameworks (especially in JS, nodeJS..) automatically add extra headers, you have to make sure to remove them in order to get a response from the API.

API-SPORTS Account
If you decided to subscribe directly on our site, you have a dashboard at your disposal at the following url: dashboard

It allows you to:

To follow your consumption in real time

RAPIDAPI Account
All information related to your subscription are available on the rapidApi developer dashboard.

The RapidAPI developer dashboard is where you can see all of your apps, locate API keys, view analytics, and manage billing settings.

To access the dashboard, simply login to RapidAPI and select 'My Apps' in the top-right menu. Alternatively, you can head directly to https://rapidapi.com/developer/dashboard.

In the main dashboard, you will see account-wide analytics and account information. To get more detailed information, you can select tabs on the left-hand side of the screen.

App Specific Analytics
Using the RapidAPI dashboard, you can also view analytics specific to each app in your account. To do so, switch over to the 'Analytics' tab of your application in the dashboard.

On the top of the page, you'll be able to see a chart with all the calls being made to all the APIs your app is connected to. You'll also be able to see a log with all the request data. You are also able to filter these analytics to only show certain APIs within the app.

In each graph, you can view the following metrics:

API Calls: how many requests are being made
Error rates: how many requests are error some
Latency: how long (on average) requests take to execute
You may change the time period you're looking at by clicking the calendar icon and choosing a time range.

Headers sent as response
When consuming our API, you will always receive the following headers appended to the response:

server: The current version of the API proxy used by RapidAPI.
x-ratelimit-requests-limit: The number of requests the plan you are currently subscribed to allows you to make, before incurring overages.
x-ratelimit-requests-remaining: The number of requests remaining before you reach the limit of requests your application is allowed to make, before experiencing overage charges.
X-RapidAPI-Proxy-Response: This header is set to true when the RapidAPI proxy generates the response, (i.e. the response is not generated from our servers)

Leagues
Leagues
Get the list of available leagues and cups.

The league id are unique in the API and leagues keep it across all seasons

To get the logo of a competition you have to call the following url: https://media.api-sports.io/football/leagues/{league_id}.png

This endpoint also returns the coverage of each competition, which makes it possible to know what is available for that league or cup.

The values returned by the coverage indicate the data available at the moment you call the API, so for a competition that has not yet started, it is normal to have all the features set to False. This will be updated once the competition has started.

You can find all the leagues ids on our Dashboard.

Example :

"coverage": {
  "fixtures": {
      "events": true,
      "lineups": true,
      "statistics_fixtures": false,
      "statistics_players": false
  },
  "standings": true,
  "players": true,
  "top_scorers": true,
  "top_assists": true,
  "top_cards": true,
  "injuries": true,
  "predictions": true,
  "odds": false
}
In this example we can deduce that the competition does not have the following features: statistics_fixtures, statistics_players, odds because it is set to False.

The coverage of a competition can vary from season to season and values set to True do not guarantee 100% data availability.

Some competitions, such as the friendlies, are exceptions to the coverage indicated in the leagues endpoint, and the data available may differ depending on the match, including livescore, events, lineups, statistics and players.

Competitions are automatically renewed by the API when a new season is available. There may be a delay between the announcement of the official calendar and the availability of data in the API.

For Cup competitions, fixtures are automatically added when the two participating teams are known. For example if the current phase is the 8th final, the quarter final will be added once the teams playing this phase are known.

Examples available in Request samples "Use Cases".

Most of the parameters of this endpoint can be used together.

Update Frequency : This endpoint is updated several times a day.

Recommended Calls : 1 call per hour.

AWD	Technical Loss	Not Played	
WO	WalkOver	Not Played	Victory by forfeit or absence of competitor
LIVE	In Progress	In Play	Used in very rare cases. It indicates a fixture in progress but the data indicating the half-time or elapsed time are not available
Fixtures with the status TBD may indicate an incorrect fixture date or time because the fixture date or time is not yet known or final. Fixtures with this status are checked and updated daily. The same applies to fixtures with the status PST, CANC.

The fixtures ids are unique and specific to each fixture. In no case an ID will change.

Not all competitions have livescore available and only have final result. In this case, the status remains in NS and will be updated in the minutes/hours following the match (this can take up to 48 hours, depending on the competition).

Although the data is updated every 15 seconds, depending on the competition there may be a delay between reality and the availability of data in the API.

Update Frequency : This endpoint is updated every 15 seconds.

Recommended Calls : 1 call per minute for the leagues, teams, fixtures who have at least one fixture in progress otherwise 1 call per day.

Odds (In-Play)
odds/live
This endpoint returns in-play odds for fixtures in progress.

Fixtures are added between 15 and 5 minutes before the start of the fixture. Once the fixture is over they are removed from the endpoint between 5 and 20 minutes. No history is stored. So fixtures that are about to start, fixtures in progress and fixtures that have just ended are available in this endpoint.

Update Frequency : This endpoint is updated every 5 seconds.*

* This value can change in the range of 5 to 60 seconds

INFORMATIONS ABOUT STATUS

"status": {
    "stopped": false, // True if the fixture is stopped by the referee for X reason
    "blocked": false, // True if bets on this fixture are temporarily blocked
    "finished": false // True if the fixture has not started or if it is finished
},
INFORMATIONS ABOUT VALUES

When several identical values exist for the same bet the main field is set to True for the bet being considered, the others will have the value False.

The main field will be set to True only if several identical values exist for the same bet.

When a value is unique for a bet the main value will always be False or null.

Example below :

"id": 36,
"name": "Over/Under Line",
"values": [
    {
        "value": "Over",
        "odd": "1.975",
